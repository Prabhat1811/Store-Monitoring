We store the csv files here.

As they were more than 100 mbs in size, I could not upload them to github.

We have 3 files here:

1. store_status.csv, Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UIx1hVJ7qt_6oQoGZgb8B3P2vd1FD025/view
2. store_timezones.csv, Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/101P9quxHoMZMZCVWQ5o-shonk2lgK1-o/view
3. menu_hours.csv, Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1va1X3ydSh-0Rt1hsy2QSnHRA4w57PcXg/view
